# Downloading the Test-Check PDF Folders
Please download all test check folders, which are provided as PDF files, from the designated source. 
These documents are intended solely for verifying and validating the Java-based files within the project.
After downloading, ensure that:
Every PDF test-check folder is fully retrieved without missing pages or corrupted files.
The original folder names and file structure remain intact.
The PDFs are stored in the appropriate directory as outlined in the project structure.
These test-check PDFs serve as reference materials to confirm file accuracy, ensure consistency, 
and support quality assurance throughout the development process.
